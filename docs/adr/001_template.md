## 1. Context & Problem Statement

Describe the issue or architectural challenge you are facing. Why does a decision need to be made right now? Keep it clear and concise.

> Example: We need to store user preferences and sensor logs locally on the micro-controller, but our available EEPROM space is insufficient.

## 2. Decision Drivers (Goals & Constraints)

List the main objectives, limitations, or requirements that influence this decision:

- **Goal 1:** Must handle up to 10,000 write cycles per day.
- **Goal 2:** Cost must remain under $5 per unit.
- **Constraint:** Must fit within our existing physical enclosure dimensions.

## 4. Decision & Justification

**Chosen Option:** Option [X] — [Name of Option]

### Rationale

Explain why this option was selected over the others. Connect the decision back to the goals and constraints in Section 2.

> Example: We chose Option 2 because it meets our cost budget of under $5 while providing significantly better read/write speed than Option 1. Although Option 3 offered better long-term reliability, its high unit price makes it unfeasible for our production scale.
